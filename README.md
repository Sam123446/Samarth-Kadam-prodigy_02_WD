Stopwatch Application
As a part of Task 2 in my internship journey, I focused on developing
an interactive stopwatch application to enhance my JavaScript and
front-end programming skills.
Task Overview
In Task 2,l built a fully functional stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. The stopwatch included features such as start, stop,
reset, and lap time recording. I focused on creating a clean,
user-friendly interface with smooth functionality and responsive
design to ensure usability across devices.
Skills and Knowledge Gained
This task helped me deepen my understanding of DOM
manipulation, event handling, and timer functions in JavaScript. I
also enhanced my ability to design intuitive Ul components and
manage application state, which are essential skills in front-end web
development.
